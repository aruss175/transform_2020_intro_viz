        "Most geoscientists, especially those working in energy/mining companies are familiar with specific domain software.  These software have existed in these industries for the past 25 years and they have left a significant imprint on how we expect geologic data to be presented.  Think about how many powerpoints you may have seen that have screenshots from certain petrophysical or oil and gas software in them.  \n",

        "\n",
        "* What units are you in?  \n",
        "* What scale to use?  \n",
        "* What is familiar to your audience? Are you presenting to hardcore petrophysicists or more general geoscientists?  Geophysicists? \n",
        "* What visualization dimensions (ie length/width) make sense?\n",
        "* How can you ensure that the audience is seeing things in the right units?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Unlocking Storytelling with Interactivity\n",
        "\n",
        "From my experience, adding interactivity to your visualizations within a live sharing session in a notebook (or web GUI) for demoing to \"non-coding\" geoscientists has two benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Prevents \"overwhelming\"\n",
        "2. Proves that what you are doing actually works (question-ready!)\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the topic of being overwhelming.  If you create some huge plot or dashboard showing well data from 10 different wells with cross plots, histograms, and a well section all at one time, it may look impressive, but more than likely, especially if you have an audience that doesn't look at a lot of python notebooks, they will be very confused.  And most likely, any units or measurements will be too small to read.  Begin by showing each of the components and the interactivity available there. For example, swap between wells, or between lithologies on the individual plots.  Allow them to work with the individual components before revealing the big final dashboard or summarizing plot.  We will have some examples of this below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Doesn't this terrify you?:\n",
        "<p><img src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/dashboarding/Dashboards-vid-01-v01.png\" ></p>\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, interactivity allows you to be \"question-ready\".  I expect that when presenting you are trying to answer a question or investigate a certain problem with your code.  Anticipate what the audience will ask about and allow them through interactivity to ask these questions on the fly, while you change the plots to show them what they are interested in.  For example, an audience member may ask \"We didn't see this problem in Well X, does your data show that?\" - use the interactivity you have built in to allow you to quickly change the plot to look at Well X.  Your audience will trust you more and it often leads to great discussions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Trust\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, all these \"soft things\" above drive at gaining trust with your audience when presenting code.  At least in my workplace, demonstrating in a python notebook is still very foreign to the geoscience community.  It is up to you to prove that your work is of the same quality (perhaps better) than the software systems they currently trust!"
